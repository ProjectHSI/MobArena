# Mob Arena

Currently under development, Mob Arena is planning to be a wave-based mob survival.

# Release Schedule

There isn't a true release schedule, but there are some conditions for releases.

This section lists them.

## Production

Releases are simply made whenever I feel a certain change I was making is ready.

They'll be labelled as a release (unless I'm running a beta test) and will be named with the Semantic Version scheming.

If the release is labelled as a pre release, the version will be the next version with build metadata attached.

## Nightly

Pre-releases are made whenever I decide to work on this project.

They'll be labelled as a pre-release and will be named with the last git commit hash they were created with.

# GitHub Repository Development

GitHub features will be used overtime if deemed appropriate for this project.

This GitHub repository is not complete yet, so this GitHub repository's configuration may change at any time without warning.

# Security Notices

Mob Arena is under development and is ***not*** secure. Players can make changes to anything at will.

Do ***not*** deploy this onto a production server, at least not until the first true release is made.

## Permissions

There are currently no permissions. Permissions are not a priority during prototyping. I'll add them when I think the project is ready.

## Vulnerabilities

While these aren't top-priority, please report them if you can.
