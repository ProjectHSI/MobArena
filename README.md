Currently under development, Mob Arena is planning to be a wave-based mob survival.

# Release Schedule

There isn’t a true release schedule, but there are some conditions for releases.

This section lists them.

## Production

I make releases whenever I feel a certain change I was making is ready.

I will label them as a release (unless I’m running a beta test) and named with the Semantic Version scheming.

If I label the release as a pre-release, the version will be the next version with build metadata attached.

## Nightly

GitHub Actions make pre-releases whenever I decide to work on this project.

GitHub Actions will label them a pre-release and name them with the last Git commit hash they were created with.

# GitHub Repository Development

I will use GitHub’s features over time if deemed appropriate for this project.

This GitHub repository is not complete yet,
so this GitHub repository’s configuration may change at any time without warning.

# Security Notices

Mob Arena is under development and is ***not*** secure. Players can make changes to anything at will.

Do ***not*** deploy this onto a production server, at least not until I make the first true release.

## Permissions

There are currently no permissions.
Permissions aren’t a priority during prototyping.
I will add them when I think the project is ready.

## Vulnerabilities

While these aren’t top-priority, please report them to me.
